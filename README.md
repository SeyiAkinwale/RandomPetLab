# AND101 Lab 5 - Choosing API

Submitted by: **Seyi Akinwale**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Using Pet Api to get pet images

**RandomPet** is an android app that **"displays a random pet from an API")**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **emojis here**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [ ] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [ ] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed



## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **Dog API**.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes
In order to resolve 300s timeout it was necessary to wipe data in Device Manager.
Went to View > Tool Windows > Device Manager to open Device Manager

Submitted by: **Seyi Akinwale**

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## Using Pet Api to get pet images

**RandomPet** is an android app that **"displays a random pet from an API")**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **emojis here**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [ ] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [ ] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [ ] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed



## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **enter here**.
